# Log Parsing Script

## Overview

This repository contains a Python script (`0-stats.py`) designed to parse log files in a specific format and compute various metrics based on the input. The script reads stdin line by line, processes the log entries, and outputs statistics after every 10 lines or a keyboard interruption (CTRL + C).

## Tasks

### Log Parsing (Task 0)

- **Description:** Write a script that reads stdin line by line and computes metrics based on the given input format.
  
- **Input Format:**
  ```
  <IP Address> - [<date>] "GET /projects/260 HTTP/1.1" <status code> <file size>
  ```
  (If the format is not this one, the line must be skipped)

- **Metrics to Compute:**
  - Total file size
  - Number of lines by status code (possible status codes: 200, 301, 400, 401, 403, 404, 405, 500)

- **Output Format:**
  ```
  Total file size: File size: <total size>
  <status code>: <number>
  ```

- **Additional Information:**
  - After every 10 lines and/or a keyboard interruption (CTRL + C), print the specified statistics from the beginning.

## Sample Usage

```bash
./0-generator.py | ./0-stats.py
